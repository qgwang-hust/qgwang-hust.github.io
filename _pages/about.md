About me
======

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

My research focuses on *deployable* hardware accelerators (with special interests in FPGAs) for complex graph applications such as dynamic graph processing and hypergraph analysing.
