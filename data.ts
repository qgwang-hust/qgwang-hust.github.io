  bio: "I am an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I received my Ph.D. degree from HUST under the supervision of Prof. Xiaofei Liao. From March 2023 to March 2025, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Zhejiang Lab, advised by Prof. Hai Jin. My research interests focus on hardware–software co-design for energy-efficient sparse computing, with particular emphasis on graph processing and large language model (LLM) inference. I have published approximately 30 academic papers in top-tier international conferences and journals, including MICRO, HPCA, SC, DAC, ICDE, FPGA, ICS, ACM TACO, and IEEE TCAD.\n\nI am now looking for perspective Undergraduate Students and Master Students. If you are passionate about the above research areas and interested in working with me, please feel free to contact me via email.",
